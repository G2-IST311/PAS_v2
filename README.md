# PAS

Description 
PAS is a computer application aimed at reducing administrative time surrounding pool management, and offering more in-depth information to its users regarding their pool via more accurate, consistent pool attendance data. PAS does this by:
A)    Removing the need for pool employees to hold onto registration forms for swimmer information.
B)    Removing the need to create swimmer IDs. 
C)    Streamlining the check in process when a swimmer comes to the pool.
D)    Creating reports that offer detailed statistics about pool attendance. 

Benefits of using PAS:
For Swimmers – No longer a need to hold onto a physical pass that can be lost and difficult to replace. Less waiting time when signing into and out of pool. No need to write in a log book every time. 
For Front Desk Employees – Quick search for features allow employees to identify swimmers quicker and check them in at the press of a single button. This reduces lines during peak hours.
For Lifeguards – PAS allows employees to make notes in on user accts explaining disciplinary action or setting status to banned. Banned swimmers cannot be checked into the pool and should not be allowed to enter. This makes it easier for lifeguards to do their job of maintaining vigilance for the purpose of safety rather than for supervision or “babysitting”.
For Managers – PAS automatically tracks all visits which can be called upon to create detailed reports that offer insight into pool use, such as average load by hour, and each customer own attendance. The date range for all these reports can be changed as well. This can offer valuable information that managers can use to make decisions such as changing hours of operation or staffing adjustments to better fit the needs of the pool.

Installation
